Before uploading photos You should create at least one gallery.
To do this go to SX Photo Gallery -> Manage SX Galleries and enter name for new gallery. You can also add some description (optional)
and specify slug (unique). If you don't specify a slug it will be generated from gallery name. Slug is used when you output the gallery.

4. And lower in same screen area click "Set featured image".
5. Select desired image from existing photos in media library or upload some new and add them.
6. Press "Publish" and photo will be added to the gallery.

After these actions Your gallery will be ready to use.
You can output the gallery multiple ways:
* Use a shortcode "SXPhotoGallery" in a page content. Example: [SXPhotoGallery gallery-slug] where "gallery-slug" is
a slug of Your gallery.
* Another way to add a gallery is simply go to edit page where you want to add a gallery.
Above the editor section there will be a button "Insert SX Photo Gallery". Press it and select a gallery from the list.
Than press "Insert" and a shortcode will be added to editor. Save the changes and gallery will be added to the page.
Only one gallery can be used per shortcode, but You can use multiple shortcodes in same content area.
